It ensures the drone remains lightweight while being capable to withstand mechanical stress during flight. It's non-corrosive properties make it ideal for long-term use in various environments.

## Component Selection:

**1.Motor**
- Model: Ecoll 2814-830(830)
- The Ecoll 2814-830(830) motor is a high-performance brushless outrunner motor designed primarily for RC aircraft.
- No load current is 1.3A @ 10 V.
- The notation **2814** indicates the size of stator i.e 28 is the **diameter** of stator in mm and 14 is the **height** of the stator in mm.
- The notation **830** indicates the kv i.e velocity constant the motor runs at speed of **830 rpm at 1 volt**.

I learnt about the diffrences between the 2.4GHz and 5GHz radio frequencies  

**2.4GHz** 
- The most common radio frequency and known as single band frequency.
- Most of the devices use 2.4GHz frequency that leads potential signal overlap and congestion.
- Transmitts data at a slower speed.
- It has long range.
- It can penetrate solid objects better. 
- Among 11 channels it has only 3 non-overlapping channels.

![alt image](https://github.com/Vishalpolicepatil/Report-Level-1/blob/main/2.4GHz%20channels.png?raw=true)

**5 GHz**
- The radio frequency also known as double band frequency.
- Few devices use 5GHz radio frequency it is less crowded.
- Transmitts data at higher speed.
- It has short range.
- Harder to penetrating solid objects.
- It has 24 non-overlapping channels.
  
![alt image](https://github.com/Vishalpolicepatil/Report-Level-1/blob/main/best-5ghz-channel-bands-diagram.jpg?raw=true)

### LORAWAN
- Long Range Wide Area Network.
- LORAWAN uses an unlicensed frequency band for long-range communication.
- It can be used for a range of 3 miles in urban area and 10 miles in rural area.
- LORAWAN devices can have battery life of more than 12 years because it operates at low power and low bandwidth.

#### LoRaWAN Devices 
**Class A**
- Longest battery life.
- Stays in the sleeping mode majority of the time.
- It is bi-directional communication device.
- It can response to the messages(Downlink) only if it sent the messages(uplink). \
Ex:- Fire alaram, Flood detector, etc

**Class B**
- Average battery life.
- Listens to network periodically.
- It can receive messages (down link) even if it has not sent messages.
Ex:- Metering of temp, Humidity, etc

**Class C**
- Lowest battery life.
- Listens to the network continuously.
- It has min latency for messages (downlink and uplink) 
Ex:- Traffic monitoring

2. ExpressLRS is more affordable than Crossfire.
3. Low latency (Transmitter can send messages to the receiver 1000 times per sec) i.e maximum update rate is 1000Hz.

cons: 
1. ExpressLRS is somewhat more technically complex than other RC systems.
2. ELRS communication isn’t secured and isn’t jam resistant.
3.  ELRS supports up to 12 channels due to limited bandwidth.
