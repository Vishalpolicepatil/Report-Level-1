# Task :1 Assembling a Drone using eCalc

**Objective:**
To write about different materials to assemble a drone with an empty weight of 800g. State the reasons behind material selection and endurance. Calculate the thrust, battery, ESC, and other materials needed for the drone.

## Material Selection:

For the drone frame, *Carbon fibre* was selected due to it's exceptional strength-to-weight ratio, rigidity, and resistance to deformation. It ensures the drone remains lightweight while being capable to withstand mechanical stress during flight. It's non-corrosive properties make it ideal for long-term use in various environments.

## Component Selection:

**1.Motor**
- Model: 4-max PPO-3536-1250(1250)
- Justification: The 4-Max PPO-3536-1250 motor is a high-performance brushless outrunner motor designed primarily for RC aircraft.

**2.Propellers**

- Model: DJI 10 inch with 4.7 width.
- Justification: DJI propellers are designed specifically for *High efficiency,* *Stabilty,* and *low noise.*

 **3.Battery**

 - Model: LiPo 5000mAh, 45/60c.
 - Justification: Battery offers capacity to sustain hover flight of 6.9 min.

**4.ESC(Electronic speed controller)**

- Model: Max 100A.
- Justification: It can handel high current, making it suitable for high power application.

**5.Frame**
- Material: Carbon fiber (weight: 200 grams).
  
- Justification: Lightweight and durable, enhancing stability and endurance.

## Outcomes from eCalc:

1.**Thrust-to-weight ratio:**
- Achieved:  **2:1**
- To ensure stable flight at playload **1706 g** \
2.**Hover flight time:**
- Achieved: **6.9 min** \
3.**Mixed flight time:**
- Achieved: **5.6 min** \
4.**Total weight:**
- Achieved: All up weight is **2278 g**\
5.**Maximum Speed:**
- Achieved: **72 Kmph** \
6.**Efficiency at hover:**
- Achieved: **76.1%** \
7.**Estimated temeprature of motor:**
- Achieved: **33Â°C**

## Analysis

### Component compatibilty 
The motor, ESC, and propellers are well-matched, as evidenced by the efficiency and stable RPM performance. The selected battery complements the overall design, allowing sustained operation without overheating.

# Task :2 Flying the Airblock Drone

**Objective:**
To learn to fly a drone and making take-off and landing perfectly and have fun experience.

**Outcomes&Learnings:** 
I have learnt the basic protocols of flying and understood the basic safety standards.

I had oppurtunity to fly the airblock drone and i have learnt to use Makeblock application it contains guide to make block to an toy which can fly, move on land, and swim in the water and blocks can be arranged if we have idea to make it better model and **programme** it.

It maintains **Digital Sky Platform** of **India** which issues license to various Unmanned aircraft and cretates the Red, Yellow and Green Zones 

**Red Zone:**
It includes areas where drone operations are strictly prohibited unless explicitly permitted by the Central Government. \
**Yellow Zone:**
 The specified airspace over Indian territorial waters and land areas that is off-limits to unmanned aircraft system operations and requires authorization from the relevant air traffic control authority. \
**Green Zone:**
It encompasses airspace up to 400 feet and areas within 8-12 km from the perimeter of an operational airport up to 200 feet.
