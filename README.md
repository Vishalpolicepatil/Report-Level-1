# Task :1 Basic UAV Assembly & Components Familiarization


**Objective:**
To write about different materials to assemble a drone with an empty weight of 800g. State the reasons behind material selection and endurance. Calculate the thrust, battery, ESC, and other materials needed for the drone.

## Material Selection:

For the drone frame, *Carbon fibre* was selected due to it's exceptional strength-to-weight ratio, rigidity, and resistance to deformation. It ensures the drone remains lightweight while being capable to withstand mechanical stress during flight. It's non-corrosive properties make it ideal for long-term use in various environments.

## Component Selection:

**1.Motor**
- Model: Ecoll 2814-830(830)
- The Ecoll 2814-830(830) motor is a high-performance brushless outrunner motor designed primarily for RC aircraft.
- No load current is 13A @ 1 V.
- The notation **2814** indicates the size of stator i.e 28 is the **diameter** of stator in mm and 14 is the **height** of the stator in mm.
- The notation **830** indicates the kv i.e velocity constant the motor runs at speed of **830 rpm at 1 volt**.
- The speed of the motor kept slow due to large propellers size which cause increase in the temperature and heat loss in thr system.

**2.Propellers**

- Model: DJI 10 inch with 4.7 inch width.
- DJI propellers are designed specifically for *High efficiency,* *Stabilty,* and *low noise.*
- The **10 inch** is the **diameter** of the propeller.
- **4.7 inch** is the **pitch** of the propeller.
- The size of the propeller is kept large to maintain weight-to-thrust ratio.


 **3.Battery**

 - Model: LiPo 2200mAh, 80/120c.
 - The **Lipo** indicates the **Lithium polymer battery** is used which has properties like *light weight, more discharge rate, and high current density.*
 - It can discharge 2.2 A per hour.
 - The notation **80/120 c** indicates the **capacity rate to discharge**.
 - **80 c** is the **continous discharge rate** and **120 c** is the **brust discharge rate** which last's only for few sec and it is the maximum discharge rate.
 - 6 cell Ni-metal hydride battery is equal to 2 cell Lipo battery.
  

**4.ESC(Electronic speed controller)**

- Model: Max 20A.
- It can handel high current, making it suitable for high power application.
- It is **20%** more than the maximum current drawn by the motor to satishify the condition.

**5.Frame**
- Material: Carbon fiber (weight: 200 grams).
  
- Lightweight and durable, enhancing stability and endurance.

## Outcomes from eCalc:

1.**Thrust-to-weight ratio:**
 Achieved:  **3:1** \
To ensure stable flight at playload **1376 g** \
 2.**Hover flight time:** \
 Achieved: **13.5 min** \
3.**Mixed flight time:** \
 Achieved: **7.7 min** \
4.**Total weight:** \
 Achieved: All up weight is **850 g**\
5.**Maximum Speed:** \
 Achieved: **61 Kmph** \
6.**Efficiency at hover:**
 Achieved: **73.3 %** \
7.**Estimated temeprature of motor:** \
 Achieved: **31Â°C**

## Analysis

### Component compatibilty 
The motor, ESC, and propellers are well-matched, as evidenced by the efficiency and stable RPM performance. The selected battery complements the overall design, allowing sustained operation without overheating.

# Task :3 Regulations 

**Objective:** 
To learn about ICAO, SARPS, QCI, BIS, stakeholders, BVLOS, and their basic laws.\
**Outcomes&Learning:**
### ICAO : International Civil Aviation Organization 

ICAO is a United Nations agency that helps countries cooperate in the field of civil aviation, promoting safe, efficient, and sustainable air travel.

It maintains **Digital Sky Platform** of **India** which issues license to various Unmanned aircraft and cretates the Red, Yellow and Green Zones 

**Red Zone:**
It includes areas where drone operations are strictly prohibited unless explicitly permitted by the Central Government. \
**Yellow Zone:**
 The specified airspace over Indian territorial waters and land areas that is off-limits to unmanned aircraft system operations and requires authorization from the relevant air traffic control authority. \
**Green Zone:**
It encompasses airspace up to 400 feet and areas within 8-12 km from the perimeter of an operational airport up to 200 feet.
